This is the "todo list" assignment from The Odin Project. I actually started it once but ended up scrapping it because I found the code got too unwieldy -- the second time I made more of an effort to write it in discrete blocks, and it came together pretty easily.

I've been neglecting uploading my stuff to Git until now, but starting with this project I'm going to get more in the habit of doing so.

The aim of this project is less to demonstrate any particular skill and more as a means of practicing all the skills learned so far in general. Dealing with local storage, however, was new for me.
